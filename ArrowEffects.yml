#Each ShapeChar is set to one CharMat (A is Feather, B is Stick, C is snowball, D is empty space). You can freely add to this list up to 9 ShapeChars (Because MineCraft has max. 9 different Crafting components!)
#Shape-1 to Shape-3 looks like a crafting grid (Like a crafting table ingame!) It will take the ShapeChars, and the plugin will look which ShapeMat is linked to it, and prepare the crafting recipe.
#If you want your CharMat to have a DataValue, simply add a ',' (comma) and the number behind it like so: - LOG,2 (this would be birch wood)
